          <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
          <h4>
          Since I was 5 I’ve been surrounded by computers and videogames which probably laid the foundations of an interest for technology. This interest took me to a pivotal decision, shifting from a 10+ years working in the craft beer industry and being a beer sommelier, to changing my career to become a developer. Fueled by this determination, I've completed all courses and education I could find over the last year to strengthen my skills, ensuring a transition into a developer role.
          <br />
          <br />
          I believe that my brain naturally works exactly the way a developer thinks, with the logic and
          synchronous (or asyc.) side of programming as well as being fullfilled by the creative side of 
          building a website. I really enjoy minimalist designs, inspired by the likes of Next JS and Vercel.
           When I see a project built with frameworks I'm not familiar with, I instantly get an “I want to 
           learn this” feeling, and I already have on sight learning Remix, ThreeJS and Python. Now I’m looking to
            be part of a bigger team and contribute to wider projects with my skills and personality.
