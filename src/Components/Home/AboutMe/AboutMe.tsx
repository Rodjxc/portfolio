          <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
          <h4>
          Since I was 5 I’ve been surrounded by computers and videogames which probably laid the foundations of an 
          interest for technology. This interest took me to a pivotal decision, shifting from a 10+ years working in the craft beer
          industry and being a <span><a href="https://www.beerandcideracademy.org/meet-the-sommeliers/2018/10/10/rodrigo-jimeno" className="sommelier" data-cursor-text ="Wanna know more?" target="_blank">beer sommelier</a></span>, to changing
           my career to become a developer. 
          <br />
          <br />
          I believe that my brain naturally works exactly the way a developer thinks, with the logic and
          synchronous (or asyc.) side of programming as well as being fullfilled by the creative side of 
          building a website. Before I used my creativity to make original and tasty beers and now I use it
           to create web applications. I really enjoy minimalist designs inspired by the likes of Next JS and Vercel.

           When I see a project built with frameworks I'm not familiar with, I instantly get an “I want to 
           learn this” feeling, and I already have on sight learning Remix, ThreeJS and Python. Now I’m looking to
            be part of a bigger team and contribute to wider projects with my skills and personality.
          <br />
          <br />
          Oh, and I also have <span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/sendaplays" className="sommelier" data-cursor-text ="A weird hobby" target="_blank">a YouTube channel</a></span>  where I make guides for videogames!
