              During the time of my studies I've been able to partake in all the
              projects and works shown in my portfolio and it's been an
              assurance that development has been the right career path for me.
              Beyond coding, I brought concepts to life and coded websites with
              React, Vite and NodeJS or Webflow from Figma designs. It's not
              just about writing code; it's a creative journey, much like
              brewing beer‚Äîfrom an idea to a tangible product and a user
              experience. And not only is it a fulfilling job but also I have
              fun alongside it.

              My role here was quite varied - not just helping with beer
              production of Schouskjelleren Bryggeri but also connecting with
              some of the managers of the best bars in Oslo. I listened to what
              they craved and sourced unique beers from around the globe. Some
              of those selections even made their way to Vinmonopolet! This role
              wasn't just about beer, but also selling and negotiating prices
              with managers, curating customer relationships and keeping up and
              understanding the trends and needs of the market. This relations
              led me to close and friendly relationships with bar owners leading
              to an increase in sales for the company and good reputation as a
              supplier. I also designed the logo and website of the company.

              I started my Content Creation journey in 2019 by starting a
              YouTube channel where I made game guides for various video games,
              which laid part of the groundwork for my transition into the
              development world. Beyond technical skills, this experience taught
              me valuable skills like discipline, commitment, keeping up to date
              with technology. Also other valuable skills like web SEO and
              picture/video editing to enhance the channel's quality, with
              allowed me to have a good eye for good UX / UI design and
              accessibility which have proven of great use in my developer
              career. All of this have resulted in a growing channel that
              recently passed the 40k mark.

              A year after I finished my university I decided to move out of my
              comfort zone and I moved to London, UK, where I worked for several
              years. I worked in hospitality both as a bartender and as a
              manager (I even helped opening and organizing Gipsy Hill's
              Brewery's Taproom in the heart of London), lead teams of 10+
              people in a very fast-paced and stressful environment as working
              in the center of a big city with people of all sorts. Thanks to my
              network and contacts I got a job for Amundsen Bryggeri in Oslo,
              which led me to move to Norway and start anew, and since I'm
              always willing to learn I embraced the change and new
              opportunities to grow.
